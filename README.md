# recommenderSystem-FYP

Performed sentiment analysis on Amazon Review Dataset available at http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html

Online shopping is all over the internet. All our needs are just a click away.But with increasing demand and transactions it becomes tough for RETAILERS to keep track of their competitive and comparative business.

Hence in our Final Year Project we propose to make RETAILERS RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM with the following features

1. Login and registration feature for manager and the salesperson with simultaneous data storage on the server.

2. Sales Manager and salesperson can update their profile details.

3. App displays all the commodities present in the inventory which the manager can add.

4. Sales Manager can view the profile of the salespersons but the salesperson can only view his profile.

5. Leaderboard of the top 10 salespersons.

6. A global chat room for the salespersons and the sales manager as well as personal chat for the salesperson and sales manager.

7. Recommendation algorithm based on the salespersonâ€™s sales to assign him a future target so that he can maximize the profit.

8. Image compression before uploading data on server to reduce server data.

9. Graphs to show the salesperson progress over time.

10. Pie graph to give profit analysis to the sales manager.
